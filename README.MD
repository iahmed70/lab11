### Section 3 Answer
> Put your answer to section 3 here:

* A written description of the call stack leading to line 133 in operators_factory.py
```
From the <module> sample.py (line 35),
to the main method in sample.py (line 29),
to the run_anonymizer method in sample.py (line 13),
to the anonymize method in AnonymizerEngine class (line 104),
to the create_operator_class method in OperatorsFactory class (line 133),
to the operator = operators_by_type.get(operator_name) line in OperatorsFactory class (line 133)

```

* How many if/elif branches are used in selecting the operator?
*There is no if/elif cascade that maps each operator name to code.
The factory does not use a long if/elif chain to pick redact, initals tc etc. rather it uses Conditional checks total 3, like ternary if not operators_by_type, if not operator*

* What data structure (a Python data type) exactly is used to select the operator?
*Dictionary*

* Explain how "Strategy" design pattern is reflected here.
* The factory demonstrates the Strategy design pattern because it selects and returns different operator objects that all implement the same Operator interface. Each concrete operator, like Redact, Mask, or Initial, encapsulates a specific anonymization or deanonymization algorithm. The OperatorsFactory allows the engine to choose which operator to use at runtime based on configuration (OperatorType and operator_name) without modifying the engine itself. This separation of algorithm selection from usage, along with the ability to add new operators without changing existing code, exemplifies the Strategy pattern.*

## What is Presidio

Presidio _(Origin from Latin praesidium ‘protection, garrison’)_ helps to ensure sensitive data is properly managed and governed. It provides fast **_identification_** and **_anonymization_** modules for private entities in text such as credit card numbers, names, locations, social security numbers, bitcoin wallets, US phone numbers, financial data and more.

## Are you using Presidio? We'd love to know how

Please help us improve by taking [this short anonymous survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR9LagCGNW01LpMix2pnFWFJUQjJDTVkwSlJYRkFPSUNNVlVRRVRWVDVNSy4u).

### Goals

- Allow organizations to preserve privacy in a simpler way by democratizing de-identification technologies and introducing transparency in decisions.
- Embrace extensibility and customizability to a specific business need.
- Facilitate both fully automated and semi-automated PII de-identification flows on multiple platforms.

### Main features

1. **Predefined** or **custom PII recognizers** leveraging _Named Entity Recognition_, _regular expressions_, _rule based logic_ and _checksum_ with relevant context in multiple languages.
2. Options for connecting to external PII detection models.
3. Multiple usage options, **from Python or PySpark workloads through Docker to Kubernetes**.
4. **Customizability** in PII identification and de-identification.
5. Module for **redacting PII text in images** (standard image types and DICOM medical images).

:warning: Presidio can help identify sensitive/PII data in un/structured text. However, because it is using automated detection mechanisms, there is no guarantee that Presidio will find all sensitive information. Consequently, additional systems and protections should be employed.
